# ORA KEGG analysis {#ora-kegg-analysis}

## KEGG intruduction {#kegg-introduction}

KEGG is short for "Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes," a collection of databases dealing with genomes, biological pathways, diseases, drugs, and chemical substances.

The pathway maps are classified into the following sections:

1. Metabolism
2. Genetic information processing (transcription, translation, replication and repair, etc.)
3. Environmental information processing (membrane transport, signal transduction, etc.)
4. Cellular processes (cell growth, cell death, cell membrane functions, etc.)
5. Organismal systems (immune system, endocrine system, nervous system, etc.)
6. Human diseases
7. Drug development

## Basic usage {#kegg-basic-usage}

> `genKEGG` is built on `clusterProfiler::enrichKEGG`

The simplest arguments are: 

- `id`: gene id of entrez, ensembl or symbol (alias is also accepted)
- `org`: organism (from `genekitr::keggOrg_name`)
- `pvalueCutoff`
- `qvalueCutoff`

```{r}
data(geneList, package = "genekitr")
id <- names(geneList)[abs(geneList) > 1]
keg <- genKEGG(id, 
               org = "human",
               pvalueCutoff = 0.05,
               qvalueCutoff = 0.05)
head(keg,5)
```

## Group enrichment {#kegg-group-enrichment}

Like [GO enrichment analysis](#go-group-enrichment), KEGG also supports multi-groups genes analysis.

```{r}
id2 <- c(head(names(geneList),100),tail(names(geneList),100))
group <- list(group1  = c(rep('up',100),rep('down',100)),
              group2 = c(rep('A',130),rep('B',70)))
gkeg <- genKEGG(id2, 
                group_list = group,
                org = "human", 
                pvalueCutoff = 0.05,
                qvalueCutoff = 0.05)
head(gkeg,5)
```
