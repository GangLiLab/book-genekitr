# Probe ID conversion {#probe-id-conversion}

Microarray probes are used to measure the expression level of large number of genes. After we get microarray data, the first important thing before downstream analysis is probe id conversion.

`genekitr::transProbe` is built on [Ensembl up-to-date annotation datasets](https://www.ensembl.org/info/genome/microarray_probe_set_mapping.html) and could join together with other genekitr functions elegantly.

Supported platforms can be listed by:

```{r}
DT::datatable(hsapiens_probe_platform, options = list(pageLength = 10))
```

## Probe id conversion {#transid-convert-probe}

User only needs to input probe id, organism and wanted conversion type, left things just give genekitr!

```{r}
data(deg, package = "genekitr")
probes = deg$probe_id

transProbe(probes,"symbol",org = "human")
```
