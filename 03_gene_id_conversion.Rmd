# (PART\*) Part II: ID Conversion {-}


# Gene ID conversion {#gene-id-conversion}

The popular gene ID types include Symbol, NCBI Entrez and Ensembl. ID conversion among different types is very common. 


## Current tools {#convertion-current-tools}

Now there are many tools could handle id conversion including `r Biocpkg("biomaRt")`, `r Biocpkg("clusterProfiler.")` .

biomaRt is frequently used to access Ensembl database while clusterProfiler depends on NCBI database via organism annotation database packages of Bioconductor.

genekitr combines both Ensembl and NCBI database to provide more comprehensive gene id mapping.
