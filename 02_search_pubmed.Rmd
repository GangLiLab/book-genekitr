# Search PubMed records {#search-pubmed}

`getPubmed` function could use `r CRANpkg("europepmc")` to easily get PubMed records by searching paper abstract.

A user needs to input the `term` argument; if there is any supplement information, the `keys` parameter is available.

For example, if we want to check papers for genes "Tp53", "Brca1," and "Tet2" in mouse stem cells, we could write codes like this:

```{r}
term <- c("Tp53","Brca1","Tet2")
keys <- c('stem cell','mouse')
l <- getPubmed(term,keys)
names(l)
DT::datatable(l$Tp53, options = list(pageLength = 10))
```

NOTICE:
A minor update has been made in version 0.8.6 or above. Argument `keys` is replaced with `add_term` for easy understanding, and the `num` parameter is added to specify the number of returned records.

```{r eval=FALSE}
term <- c("Tp53","Brca1","Tet2")
add_term <- c('stem cell','mouse')
l <- getPubmed(term,add_term,num=30)
```
