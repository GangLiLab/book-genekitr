<p><code>getPubmed</code> function could use <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=europepmc">europepmc</a> to easily get PubMed records by searching paper abstract.</p>
<p>A user needs to input the <code>term</code> argument; if there is any supplement information, the <code>keys</code> parameter is available.</p>
<p>For example, if we want to check papers for genes ‚ÄúTp53‚Äù, ‚ÄúBrca1,‚Äù and ‚ÄúTet2‚Äù in mouse stem cells, we could write codes like this:</p>
