The book is a tutorial for gene information query, ID conversion, enrichment analysis, and publication-level plotting. If you are new to R, do not worry, I will set enough example codes to guide you through the book. After reading this book, you could plot your figures based on your analysis result. üìö Content Part 1 (Search Information) introduces how to search gene metadata and PubMed papers. Part 2 (ID Conversion) describes ID conversion among symbol &amp; alias, NCBI Entrez, Ensembl, Uniprot and microarray probe. Part 3 (Enrichment Analysis) describes the two widely used functional enrichment methods over-representation analysis (ORA) and functional class scoring (FCS). Part 4 (Plotting) includes 14 GO plots, 7 KEGG plots, 5 GSEA plots, 2 Venn plots, and 1 Volcano plot. ‚ù§Ô∏è Welcome to contribute Book source code at https://github.com/GangLiLab/book_genekitr.
